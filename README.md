# Philly Alexa Hackathon 10-22-2016
My hack (in every sense of the word) for the Philly Alexa Hackathon that took place on 10-22-2016. This skill and lambda won!
My buddy Marcus stood up a meteor-based end point on heroku to capture the data.

Note: This was the first skill I ever built and loosely based off the spaceGeek sample code from here:
